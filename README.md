# Megaline Telecom: Customer Behavior and Revenue Analysis

## Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of customer data for Megaline, a telecommunications operator. The primary goal is to compare two prepaid plans, **Surf** and **Ultimate**, to determine which is more profitable and to understand the consumption patterns of their respective users. The analysis is based on a dataset from 500 Megaline customers, covering their service usage (calls, SMS, and data) throughout 2018.

The findings from this analysis are intended to help the commercial department make data-driven decisions regarding its advertising budget and strategic focus.

## Key Objectives

1.  **Data Preparation:** Clean, preprocess, and aggregate the raw data. This involved correcting data types, handling missing values, and calculating each user's total monthly calls, minutes, messages, and data volume.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze and visualize the behavior of customers on each plan. We calculated descriptive statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation) and plotted histograms to understand the distributions of service usage.
3.  **Revenue Calculation:** For each user, calculate the monthly revenue generated by subtracting the free plan limits from their total usage, multiplying the excess by the corresponding rates, and adding the base monthly fee.
4.  **Hypothesis Testing:** Conduct statistical tests to validate two key hypotheses:
    *   The average revenue from users of the **Ultimate** and **Surf** plans differs.
    *   The average revenue from users in the **NY-NJ area** is different from that of users in other regions.
5.  **Actionable Recommendations:** Provide clear, data-driven recommendations to the business based on the analysis.

## Summary of Findings

*   **Ultimate Plan is More Profitable:** Statistical testing confirmed that the **Ultimate plan generates significantly higher average revenue per user** than the Surf plan. Although Surf users frequently incur overage charges, the high base monthly fee of the Ultimate plan makes it the superior revenue driver on a per-customer basis.
*   **Data Drives Overage Charges:** The main reason Surf plan users pay extra is **data consumption**. The average Surf user's data needs exceed their 15 GB allowance, leading to frequent and costly overage fees ($10 per GB).
*   **Ultimate Plan Provides "Peace of Mind":** Ultimate plan customers have generous allowances that they rarely exceed. This plan is well-suited for high-usage customers who value cost predictability.
*   **No Significant Regional Revenue Difference:** The analysis found no statistically significant difference in average revenue between customers in the New York-New Jersey area and those in other regions.

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following strategies are recommended for Megaline's commercial department:

1.  **Focus Advertising on the Ultimate Plan:** Allocate a larger portion of the advertising budget to promoting the Ultimate plan, highlighting its "worry-free" value proposition for high-usage customers.
2.  **Upsell High-Spending Surf Customers:** Proactively identify Surf users who consistently pay high overage fees and target them with campaigns to upgrade to the Ultimate plan. This can increase customer satisfaction and secure a more stable revenue stream.
3.  **Introduce a Mid-Tier Plan:** Consider creating a new plan (e.g., "Surf Plus") with a more generous data allowance (e.g., 25-30 GB) at a price point between Surf and Ultimate. This could capture a segment of customers who need more data but are not ready to commit to the Ultimate plan's price.
